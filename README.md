EDA on playstore application metada and user reviews


The play store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success.
Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market.

Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success.

We were provided with two sets of datasets. In first dataset, each app (row) has values for
category, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps.

In our study we tried to answer some questions which can help an android app downloading
platform to attract more users and for a particular app developer to develop an app that reaches
most users with good experience.

The Problem Statement for the study is that one App installer Platform wants to know which apps
to show & arrange on homepage and which apps to recommend to customers via various social
media apps and pop-up ads based on the data provided. In addition to that they need to setup a
homepage on their app which recommends apps which attracts more users.

From Problem statement, by brainstorming some fundamental question were formulated, which
are to be answered using EDA, like best categories/genres, best apps based on user reviews, most
popular content rating type etc.

With help of Data Visualization, following Data cleaning and manipulation, the questions in the
problem statements were answered to finally reach the conclusion.
